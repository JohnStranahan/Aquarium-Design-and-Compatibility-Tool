/**
 * Plants can alter or lower PH levels under certain circumstances
 * Plants Absorb Carbon Dioxide given enough light
 * Plants Produce 02
 * Too much Carbon Dioxide lowers PH (toxic)
 * when plants absorb Carbon Dioxide the PH will rise
 *
 * plants absorb ammonia
 * ammonia lowers ph

 * EGERIA absords minerals like calcium (Water Hardness) (lower PH)
 *
 *  plants prefer certain ph and waterhardness
 * (ex. Amazon SwordPlant - soft acidic water)
 * (ex. Egeria - hard, alkalin water)
 * (ex- anuvias - adapt to many levels)

 * PH can also affect aquarium plants
